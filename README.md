Fried Banana and Chilli Sandwich

Required:

 - 1 Banana

Begin by chopping the chilli and lightly frying it, while you butter (or apply spread) to the bread. Chop the banana, 
and place inside the bread. Remove the chilli from heat, and place chopped chilli into the sandwich. Add salt. 
Put the top slice on.

With the sandwich complete, place the whole construction into as much oil as required, and fry until golden brown.

Consume whilst hot.

Repeat until almost sick.
